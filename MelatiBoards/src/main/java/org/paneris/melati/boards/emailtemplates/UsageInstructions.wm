To send a new message to the board, send an email to
$board.EmailAddress

To reply to a message, send an email to
1234.$board.EmailAddress, where 1234 is the number
of the message. You can do this easily by using your email
client's "Reply to" button. You should not use "Reply to all"
because you will send an email to each user yourself, and then
the board will send them a second copy.
