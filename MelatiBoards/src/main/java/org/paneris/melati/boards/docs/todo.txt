   making it optional to send [board] in the message subject, etc.

4) The digest mechanism

5) Date ordering

6) There seems to be a bug in the upload code (not ours) which truncates
   files and double-spaces them :-(

7) Make the display of User Email addresses a Setting option

8) Docs and comments
