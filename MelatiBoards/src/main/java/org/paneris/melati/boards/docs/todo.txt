1) Finish the UI system, in particular the ApproveMessages,
   ApproveSubscriptions and the bits that let User alter their
   settings and the manager alter the board's settings and allow
   users to subscribe others (all of these can be done through the
   Admin system)

2) Send out messages to users when they subscribe and send a message
   to a moderated board.

3) Allow upload of attachments through the web interface (need the
   'neutral' stuff)

4) Update DSD to allow users to automatically include the boards system
   into their database (currently you have to manually make sure that
   your database extends org.paneris.melati.boards.model.BoardsDatabase)

5) Re-add Score to message and do other odds and ends including 
   making it optional to send [board] in the message subject, etc.

6) The digest mechanism

7) Date ordering

8) There seems to be a bug in the upload code (not ours) which truncates
   files and double-spaces them :-(

9) Remove dependencies on mail.jar, activation.jar and Webmacro log files
   in the receivemail stuff.

10) Currently all messages in a board are sucked into memory when we look
    at any messages. This is fine for dgroup, but probably not for paneris.
    I'm not sure that caching the pages in HTML will be a good idea (imagine
    having to generate 50 pages every time you post a message to a big board)
    but I'll have a think.

11) Docs and comments

12) Pretty up the web interface a bit
